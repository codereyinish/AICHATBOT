This is an AICHATBOT  powered by Facebook's Bert model(distill version) implemented in Gradio's UI interface. Problem is I am not able to implement it in Binder.org, maybe there is some problem with configuration file setup. Issue is you have to manually reinstall transformers, gradio and pytorch to make it work though it was expected to be automatically installed during build process with DOCKER. Let me know if you can help me resolve this issue. Thanks🙏😊
